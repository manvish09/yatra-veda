            Whenever referring to the Philippines, a few things will immediately
            spring to everyoneâ€™s mind: countless white sandy beaches, delicious
            fruit, luxury shopping malls, thousands of inhabited and uninhabited
            islands. However, not many people know that the Philippines also
            owns a charming city with a colonial atmosphere which offers you a
            feeling like travelling back in time - Vigan city. This UNESCO World
            Heritage Site is situated in Ilocos Sur province, and this city
            features well-preserved Spanish-era architecture with many
            colonial-era merchant houses & Baroque churches. Aside from its
            historical significance, a holiday to Vigan can also be packed with
            a memorable cuisine adventure where you can feast on signature
            Ilocano food.
